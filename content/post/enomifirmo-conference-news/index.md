Building on my research experience at the University of Bologna, I'm now engaging with Italian Harm Reduction organizations and policy advocates to investigate and highlight evidence-based approaches that are reshaping public health discussions across Italy and Europe.

This September 4-6, I'll be attending the "E Mi No Firmo" Summer School in Florence as a member of ITARDD to advance the debate on zero-tolerance policies and promote Harm Reduction approaches in Italy.

I'll share key insights and findings from this workshop through a comprehensive report on my website and social media channels. If you're working in related fields or interested in the intersection of Harm Reduction research and advocacy, I'd love to connect and explore potential collaborations.

You can also support my work as an independent Data Activist through my GoFundMe (link below) to help sustain my research and public awareness efforts, and enable me to connect with other advocates and organizations working on these issues.

For those who've tried to influence policy with data - what was your experience? Thanks for any insights you may have! ðŸ“Š
