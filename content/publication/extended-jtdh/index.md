abstract: >
  The present paper introduces an expanded version of the European
  Parliament Translation and Interpreting Corpus (EPTIC), a multimodal parallel
  corpus comprising speeches delivered at the European Parliament along with
  their official interpretations and translations (see Bernardini et al., 2016;
  Bernardini et al., 2018). Constructing multimodal and parallel corpora for
  translation and interpreting studies (TIS) has been acknowledged as a
  “formidable task” (Bernardini et al., 2018), which – if automated, as we
  propose – involves a number of subtasks such as automatic speech
  recognition (ASR), multilingual sentence alignment, and forced alignment,
  each of which poses its own challenges. Yet tackling these subtasks also offers
  a unique way to evaluate state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP)
  tools against a unique, multilingual benchmark. In this paper we discuss the
  development of a modular pipeline adaptable for each of these subtasks and
  address the broader implications of this work for the field of corpus
  construction.
