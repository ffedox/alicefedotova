abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for constructing multimodal and multilingual parallel corpora, with a focus on evaluating state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition tools for verbatim transcription. Our findings indicate that current technologies can streamline corpus construction, with fine-tuning showing promising results in terms of transcription quality compared to out-of-the-box Whisper models.
